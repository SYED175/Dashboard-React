For onboarding students to your madrassa, it's important to balance ease of use with proper verification and management. Here’s a structured idea:

### **1. Multi-Step Onboarding Process**

Instead of a simple form, you can implement a more secure and detailed onboarding journey. This can ensure the right students are onboarded while providing a structured way to verify data.

#### **Step 1: Pre-Registration (Interest Form)**

- Create a short **interest form** where students provide basic details like their name, age, and contact information. This helps you gauge interest without committing students yet.
- **Automated response**: After filling out the interest form, they get an email or SMS confirmation with details about the next steps.

#### **Step 2: Identity Verification**

- For authenticity, send an email with a link for **identity verification** (using a third-party identity service or simple OTP verification).
- Ask for identification (government-issued ID or other documentation if needed). The verification link can include secure uploads.

#### **Step 3: Placement Assessment (Optional)**

- Offer a short **placement test** to assign them to the appropriate batch/class level.
- You can also use this opportunity to assess their motivation or skills (like prior knowledge in Islamic studies if relevant).

#### **Step 4: Approval and Final Registration**

- Once the student’s details and test results are reviewed, notify them via email/SMS.
- Send them a **final registration form** for additional details (parent/guardian info, address, etc.) and assign them a batch/class number in your system.

#### **Step 5: Payment and Document Submission (Optional)**

- If your madrassa requires fees, introduce a **payment gateway** for tuition. You can integrate services like Stripe or PayPal.
- If there are additional documents (proof of education, health records), you can request those at this stage.

#### **Step 6: Welcome and Onboarding**

- Once all is set, send a **welcome pack** via email with important information (schedule, materials, contact details for instructors).
- Provide access to the student **dashboard** where they can view their class details, materials, or even upcoming events.

### **2. Student Dashboard & Automated Emails**

- Post-onboarding, each student should have a **dashboard** where they can view their class schedules, submit assignments, track progress, and view announcements.
- Automated email updates will keep students informed about their onboarding status.

### **3. Admin Dashboard for Staff**

- For ease of management, implement an **admin dashboard** where staff can review pending students, approve them, assign batches, and view the overall onboarding progress.

### **4. Batch Enrolment Quotas**

- To prevent overcrowding in classes, set a **maximum quota** for each batch. Once a batch is full, students are placed on a waiting list or auto-assigned to the next available batch.

This approach not only adds professionalism to the onboarding process but also gives you control over verifying student authenticity while efficiently managing the number of enrollments per class.

Does this approach resonate with your vision?
